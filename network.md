The research world and academia in general is complicated and most people often wear many hats. If you don't know me, you probably know someone I know, or know someone who knows someone I know. Anyway, below is a list of people I work with who you may know (I have linked Google Scholar profiles where available). I have strong links with the [Statistical Society of Australia](https://www.statsoc.org.au/) and the [Australian Trials Methodology Network](https://monash.edu/medicine/sphpm/austrim/home) but do not list their members here (the list would be too long). In the spirit of preferring short lists to long ones, I should also recognise the many Adaptive Health Intelligence members that make my life far more enjoyable that I have chosen not to list either, but I am confident they know who they are. At a minimum, this list reminds me who I know!

# Adaptive Health Intelligence

First and foremost, I consider myself a member of the Adaptive Health Intelligence team (AHI) which has members from both The Kids Research Institute Australia and the University of Sydney. There are far too many people to list here so I have limited it to academic collaborators and statisticians.
