I maintain my publication record at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trDAMEUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). For ease (and transparency) I have grouped my publications thematically and made them available online in the following sections.

## Current methodological work

I am currently working on developing methods to enhance the design of vaccine trials to produce higher quality evidence to inform vaccine policy recommendations. This work is available below and will expand as the PhD progresses:
