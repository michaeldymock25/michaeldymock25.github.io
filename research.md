# Publications

I maintain my publication record at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=trDAMEUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). For ease (and transparency) I have grouped my publications thematically and made them available online in the following sections.

## Current work

I am currently working on developing methods to enhance the design of vaccine trials to produce higher quality evidence to inform vaccine policy recommendations. My work in this area is yet to be published but rest assured, it will be uploaded once available.

## Applied work

### Vaccine trials
