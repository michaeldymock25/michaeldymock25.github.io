I am a biostatistician based at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/) and a PhD student at [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/). 

In the spirit of open-source research I aim to make my research freely available and will find space for it somewhere on this website. This will likely include publications, blog posts, software and talks. Stay tuned.
