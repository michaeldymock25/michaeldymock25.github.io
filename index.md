I am a biostatistician based at [The Kids Research Institute Australia](https://www.thekids.org.au/) and a PhD student at the [School of Population and Global Health](https://www.uwa.edu.au/schools/population-global-health) within [The University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/). My employment is complicated so I created a diagram to help explain (below). In short, I am physically based in Perth within the [Infectious Diseses Implementation Research](https://www.thekids.org.au/our-research/early-environment/infection-and-vaccines/infectious-disease-implementation-research/) team (IDIR) within the [Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases](https://infectiousdiseases.thekids.org.au/), which is itself within The Kids Research Institute Australia. However, IDIR is also a team within [Adaptive Health Intelligence](https://adaptivehealthintelligence.org.au/) which spans IDIR and the [Health and Clinical Analytics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-centres/health-and-clinical-analytics.html) lab based at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). Here is more information about my colleagues and general [network]({% link network.md %}).

In the spirit of open-source research I aim to make my work freely available and have stored various things in various locations on this website. This includes [publications]({% link research.md %}), [blog posts]({% link posts.md %}), [software]({% link software.md %}) and [talks]({% link talks.md %}). I also have a space for [personal stuff]({% link personal.md %}) for those that are interested (there are puppies!).
