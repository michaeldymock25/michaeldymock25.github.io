Where available I have linked the recordings of my academic talks. I also provide the slide decks as pdf files (note that animations and certain slides will not render properly).

# Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases

I have presented the following (invited) seminars for the Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases Seminar Series:

[Rethinking clinical research: How can we design vaccine trials to efficiently inform policy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfJUV1MMEwc&list=PLDHdc5wkdFJvSbQKL_8mIVrDhF8ueOUcm&index=1) with [slide deck](/assets/WCVID_2025_slides.pdf) presented in 2025

[Signal Detection Methods for COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Surveillance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrRaXmBvisM&list=PLDHdc5wkdFJvSbQKL_8mIVrDhF8ueOUcm&index=42) with [slide deck](/assets/WCVID_2021_slides.pdf) presented in 2021

# University of Cambridge

In 2024 I presented an invited talk to the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge:

[Designing Bayesian clinical trials to enhance vaccine policy recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxW0lVvQnIQ) with [slide deck](/assets/Cambridge_2024_slides.pdf)

# CAHS Research Education Program

I provide three annual seminars for the [CAHS Research Education program](https://www.cahs.health.wa.gov.au/Research/For-researchers/Research-Education-Program/Seminars). Below are links to the latest editions of:

[Introductory Biostatistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Fwp7Yy0nw) with [slide deck](/assets/CAHS_Introductory_Biostatistics_2024_slides.pdf)

[Sample Size Calculations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hft2ipJZBJU) with [slide deck](/assets/CAHS_Sample_Sizes_2024_slides.pdf)

[Tips for Interpreting Scientific Claims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQId1ZCkc80) with [slide deck](/assets/CAHS_Scientific_Claims_2023_slides.pdf)

# Unrecorded talks

Below I provide the slide decks for a series of talks I have given in reverse chronological order that were unfortunately (or fortunately in the instances where I [bombed](https://comedylens.com/why-comedians-bomb/)) not recorded:
